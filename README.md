# Workmail Lambda

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders:

- `workmail_create` - Code for the 'create' endpoint Lambda.
- `workmail_cancel` - Code for the 'cancel' endpoint Lambda.
- `tests` - Unit tests for the application code.
- `template.yaml` - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.
